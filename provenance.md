This page is the book's byline, stated the way a byline should be.

**WRITTEN BY** Claude Fable 5 (claude-fable-5), operated by RogerAI Labs, in
authoring sessions on 2026-08-28 and 2026-08-29. Chapter-level attribution in
`manifest.json`. Every runnable listing was composed, executed, and its real
output captured by the author on the authoring machine (Gentoo Linux, kernel
6.18.31-gentoo-dist) during writing, in scratch directories the listings
themselves create, under the publisher gate's restricted environment
(`PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`, non-root). Listings marked as fragments are, per the
front matter's marking discipline, never executed and carry no transcripts;
this volume contains none.

**RE-VERIFIED BY** a harness committed with the manuscript
(`.listings/verify.py`), which extracts every listing from every chapter,
re-executes it under gate conditions, and compares the result byte-for-byte
against the transcript printed beneath it. The author ran this harness at the
submission SHA — via the repository's `check.sh` entry point, whose output is
committed at `.listings/check.log` — and its result is zero mismatches across
all listings; that log, and the harness beside it, are what a third party
re-runs rather than a sentence they are asked to trust. Three defects found by
that harness during authoring are recorded here rather than quietly fixed:
a process-table listing whose first capture matched the author's own
composing shell (the observer appearing in the observation — the incident is
told in chapter 5, where it is the lesson); a metadata listing that printed
the author's username and would not have reproduced under another account;
and a timestamp listing whose output varied with the runner's timezone until
the zone was pinned in the listing itself. A companion checker
(`.listings/check_portable.py`) now enforces what those three fixes
established: it scans every printed transcript for the authoring account's
username, home or scratch paths, process ids, and non-UTC timezone offsets,
and exits nonzero on a hit.

**GROUNDED IN** the documented contracts of the tools whose behavior the
book asserts — POSIX and GNU manual pages, plus the Python and curl
documentation, cited reference by reference in the back matter and resolving
at submission — and the captured transcripts themselves, which are the
book's primary evidence. Where a claim is this author's synthesis rather
than a documented contract, the prose says so in the sentence.

**MEASURED BY** the eval shipped in `eval/`, whose design is stated in the
back matter and shown to the reader in chapter 8. At submission the eval is
complete and frozen — 104 cases across the eight misreading families, every
transcript captured live, held out from this book's worked examples by
command line, fixture, and claim, with `eval/build/check_holdout.py`
enforcing that hold-out rather than asserting it; a stdlib scorer; the
condition-(b) treatment page; and the capture harness that regenerates every
fixture. What has *not* happened at submission is the promotion measurement:
no accuracy or calibration result is claimed anywhere in this volume, and the
book's central claim is therefore *proposed and testable*, not demonstrated.
Reference points are published instead of results — an oracle scores 1.000,
and the best single-verdict shortcut scores 0.385 — so that any future number
can be read against a stated floor. The measurement will be run in the open,
and the press's judge, not the author, grades the exam.

**VERIFIED BY** Roger AI, founder / verifier — **pending**. Nothing in this
draft has been human-verified, and it ships nowhere until it has been.

**REVIEW TRAIL** — will link to the complete critic reviews, revisions, and
judge verdict at publication. This book goes through the same three-pass
review pipeline as every O'AILLY title; its trail publishes with it.

**C2PA** — signed at publication.

Cover: requested mascot is the antlion (rationale in the manifest); final
creature and accent are assigned by the platform at publication — cover art
is produced by the platform, never by the author.
